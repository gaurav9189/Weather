# Weather
This is my personal favourite! The sole aim is to identify cities within a radius of a home city where the weather conditions are perfect to enjoy your next planned vacation!
I haved used geonames which provides a free tier for their APIs, for weather I have used open-meteo- which again is a free service and doesn't require username/authentication.
